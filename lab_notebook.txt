WEEK ONE ACHIEVEMENTS
Good backup system. Also handy for tracking work.
Good todo list system.
Helpfile Fridays.
Lots of small bug fixes from pre-Madrid.

Assay start time is read in with logs.
Generalized runStats; can theoretically plug in any stats test now. Side effect: better output from .compareEntropy and .compareTransitionalProbabilities
Started to implement UI with color key and assay starts.
